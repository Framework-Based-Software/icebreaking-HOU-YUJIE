# Introduction
Hi! I'm HOU YUJIE, a student in the Framework-Based Software Design and Development course.  
I'm a international student and I'm interested in computer science and I have experience in programming.  
I'm familiar with Java and C.
During my undergraduate studies, I worked on many projects, such as using Spring Boot + Vue to complete a hospital management system. I am also quite familiar with MVC architecture.  
Although I have used Python for AI training in the past, I have never had contact with Django before, so I will try it in this course.  
I'm glad to make friends with everyone.  
Group H is also available and Please feel free to join us.  
I expect to learn a lot about modern software maintenance practices and how to work with legacy systems.
